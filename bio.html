            <h4> About Taihg</h4>
<p>
  Taihg likes to create things from sleek, snazzy websites
  to even his own music (find it attached at the bottom of the page).
</p>


      <p>
          He first started creating images on 'Photoshop' at the age of 11 on good old cs2...
          and 10 years later he still hasn't upgraded!
        </p>
      <p>
        His love of all things graphical catapulted him into the world of graphic design,
        he started his own mini business online selling YouTube backgrounds and display pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
        He then went on to start selling logo designs to professional clients at the age of 16,
        this only wetted his appetite to gain a thirst of knowledge on more than just 'Photoshop'.
      </p>
<p>
At college he gained basic foundations and understanding of web building,
in classes such as web development and client side programming.
</p>

<p>
In his 2 year period at college he went on to win an in-house website competition,
leading to his group getting invited to Google HQ London to go head to head with other colleges.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately he and his group came runners up in an intense interview process,
this did not knock his confidence as he has now moved onto a new challenge,
he has come to the University of Northampton to study Business Computing (Web Design)
and who knows what he will do next!
