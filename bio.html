            <h3> About Taihg:</h3>
            <p>
                Taihg likes to create things from sleek, snazzy websites to even his own music (find it attached at the bottom of the page).
            </p>


            <p>
                He first started creating images on 'Photoshop' at the age of 11 on good old cs2... and 10 years later he still hasn't upgraded!
            </p>
            <p>
                His love of all things graphical catapulted him into the world of graphic design, he started his own mini business online selling YouTube backgrounds and display pictures.
            </p>
            <p>
                He then went on to start selling logo designs to professional clients at the age of 16, this only wetted his appetite to gain a thirst of knowledge on more than just 'Photoshop'.
            </p>
            <p>
                At college he gained basic foundations and understanding of web building, in classes such as web development and client side programming.
            </p>

            <p>
                In his 2 year period at college he went on to win an in-house website competition, leading to his group getting invited to Google HQ London to go head to head with other colleges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately he and his group came runners up in an intense interview process, this did not knock his confidence as he has now moved onto a new challenge, he has come to the University of Northampton to study Business Computing (Web Design) and who knows
                what he will do next!
